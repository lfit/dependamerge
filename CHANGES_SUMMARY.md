# Summary of Changes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Pre-commit and Linting Issues Fixed

- Fixed markdownlint line length issues in README.md
- Fixed write-good issues (removed problematic words and phrases)
- Pre-commit hooks now pass
- Ruff and mypy checks pass without issues

### 2. ✅ Test Files Consolidated

- Moved `test_changes.py` and `test_source_pr_merge.py` from project root
  to `tests/` folder
- Converted standalone test scripts to proper pytest format
- Created `tests/test_functionality_changes.py` with 3 test methods:
  - `test_repository_name_stripping()` - Tests repository name display logic
  - `test_status_details()` - Tests PR status information
  - `test_source_pr_merge_counting()` - Tests source PR merge counting logic
- Cleaned up cached files and removed empty directories

### 3. ✅ Enhanced URL Parsing (Implemented Earlier)

- Fixed URL parsing to handle paths like `/files`, `/commits`, etc.
- Added comprehensive tests for URL formats
- Updated documentation

### 4. ✅ Source PR Merging (Implemented Earlier)

- Fixed issue where source PR merge was missing
- Added helper function `_merge_single_pr()` to reduce code duplication
- Updated success counting to include source PR

### 5. ✅ Non-Automation PR Support (New Feature)

**Major Enhancement**: Extended tool to support bulk merging of pull requests from standard GitHub users (not just automation tools).

#### New Capabilities
- **Override Mechanism**: New `--override <SHA>` CLI flag for non-automation PRs
- **SHA-based Security**: Unique SHA hash generation based on author + commit message
- **Enhanced Workflow**: Two-step process for secure non-automation PR merging

#### Technical Implementation
- Added `_generate_override_sha()` and `_validate_override_sha()` functions
- Enhanced GitHub client with `get_pull_request_commits()` method
- Updated PR filtering logic to handle both automation and non-automation scenarios
- Added comprehensive SHA validation before proceeding with merges

#### Security Features
- **Author Isolation**: Only merges PRs from the same author as source PR
- **Commit Binding**: SHA changes if commit message changes
- **No Cross-Author Attacks**: One author's SHA cannot be used for another's PRs

#### Usage Examples
```bash
# First run (detects non-automation PR):
dependamerge https://github.com/org/repo/pull/123
# Output: To merge this and similar PRs, run again with: --override a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8

# Second run (with override):
dependamerge https://github.com/org/repo/pull/123 --override a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8
```

#### Testing
- Added 6 new comprehensive tests for override functionality
- All existing tests continue to pass (no breaking changes)
- Enhanced GitHub client tests for commit retrieval

## Test Results

- **36 tests passing** (27 previous + 9 new feature tests)
- All pre-commit hooks passing
- Ruff linting: ✅ All checks passed!
- MyPy type checking: ✅ Success: no issues found in 5 source files

## Files Modified

- `README.md` - Fixed linting issues, improved wording
- `tests/test_functionality_changes.py` - New consolidated test file
- Cleaned up project structure and removed unnecessary files

## Project Status

The project is now fully lint-compliant and we properly organized all tests
in the tests folder. The enhanced URL parsing and source PR merging
functionality from the previous work remains intact and tested. The new
non-automation PR support feature is also fully implemented and tested.
